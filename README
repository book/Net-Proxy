Net::Proxy
----------

This module is a framework for creating various kinds of network
proxies in a very simple way.

A proxy is a program that transfer data across a network boundary between
a client and a server. Net::Proxy introduces the concept of "connectors",
which abstract the server part (connected to the client) and the client
part (connected to the server) of the proxy.

This makes it very easy to implement specific techniques to cross a
given network boundary, possibly by using a proxy on one side of the
network fence, and a reverse-proxy on the other side of the fence.
