Net::Proxy::Connector::connect - Create CONNECT tunnels through HTTP proxies

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # sample proxy using Net::Proxy::Connector::tcp
    #                and Net::Proxy::Connector::connect
    use Net::Proxy;

    # listen on localhost:6789
    # and proxy to remotehost:9876 through proxy.company.com:8080
    # using the given credentials
    my $proxy = Net::Proxy->new(
        in  => { type => 'tcp', port => '6789' },
        out => {
            type        => 'connect',
            host        => 'remotehost',
            port        => '9876',
            proxy_host  => 'proxy.company.com',
            proxy_port  => '8080',
            proxy_user  => 'jrandom',
            proxy_pass  => 's3kr3t',
            proxy_agent => 'Mozilla/4.04 (X11; I; SunOS 5.4 sun4m)',
        },
    );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Net::Proxy::Connecter::connect> is a C<Net::Proxy::Connector> that
uses the HTTP CONNECT method to ask the proxy to create a tunnel to
an outside server.

Be aware that some proxies are set up to deny the creation of some
outside tunnels (either to ports other than 443 or outside a specified
set of outside hosts).

This connector is only an "out" connector.

=head1 CONNECTOR OPTIONS

C<Net::Proxy::Connector::connect> accepts the following options:

=head1 C<out>

=over 4

=item * host

The destination host.

=item * port

The destination port.

=item * proxy_host

The web proxy name or address.

=item * proxy_port

The web proxy port.

=item * proxy_user

The authentication username for the proxy.

=item * proxy_pass

The authentication password for the proxy.

=item * proxy_agent

The user-agent string to use when connecting to the proxy.

=head1 BUGS

All the authentication schemes supported by C<LWP::UserAgent> should be
supported (we use an C<LWP::UserAgent> internally to contact the proxy).

This means we should also support NTLM, since it is supported as from
C<libwww-perl> 5.66. C<Net::Proxy::Connector::connect> has not been
actually tested with NTLM, though. Any report of success or failure
with a NTLM proxy will be appreciated.

=head1 HISTORY

This module is based on my script C<connect-tunnel>, that provided
a command-line interface to create tunnels though HTTP proxies.
It was first published on CPAN on March 2003.

A better version of C<connect-tunnel> (using C<Net::Proxy>) is provided
this distribution.
