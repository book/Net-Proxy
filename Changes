Revision history for Perl extension Net::Proxy

0.05 Mon Apr 17 20:42:22 CEST 2006
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - added a debug() method (but all uses of it are commented out)
        - better socket management algorithm:
          + prevents deadlocks (as could occur when having a connection and
            a tunneled connection within it both going through Net::Proxy)
          + limits buffering (so as to avoid sucking a lot of memory
            when one socket sends data faster than its peer can accept it)
        [SCRIPTS]
        - patched sslh so that it can listen not only on localhost.
          (Thanks to Dieter Voegtli.)
