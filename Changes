Revision history for Perl extension Net::Proxy

0.10 Mon Oct  1 22:26:50 CEST 2007
        [DOCUMENTATION]
        - added information about the public SVN repository and the
          mailing-list
        - added a tutorial about Net::Proxy, with code examples
        [TESTS]
        - prevent t/21connect.t, t/32tcp_connect.t, t/90compile.t to fail
          when LWP::UserAgent is not installed

0.09 Thu Sep 13 11:01:21 CEST 2007
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - the notice(), info() and debug() methods now have a timestamp
        [TESTS]
        - prevent the t/37connectssl_tcp.t test script to die when one
          of the prerequisites is missing (thus removing many FAILs)

0.08 Mon Apr 23 19:08:30 CEST 2007
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - the hook callback now receives the socket on which the data
          was received, in addition to the connector
        [NEW CONNECTOR]
        - Net::Proxy::Connector::connect_ssl
          (combines Net::Proxy::Connector::connect and
          Net::Proxy::Connector::ssl in a single connector)
        [TESTS]
        - made tests more robust when connector prerequisites are missing
        - test Net::Proxy::Connector::ssl as an "in" connector
        - test the start_cleartext option of Net::Proxy::Connector::ssl

0.07 Sat Sep  2 19:47:24 CEST 2006
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - added support for SSL proxies (ssl connector)
        [NEW CONNECTOR]
        - Net::Proxy::Connector::ssl
        [TESTS]
        - add support for NET_PROXY_VERBOSITY environnement variable
          in the tests, to have more verbose tests if needed

0.06 Thu Apr 20 21:27:00 CEST 2006
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - add support for "hooks" on received data, as proposed by Martin
          Werthmöller (see http://www.cpanforum.com/threads/1991),
          but with a different implementation

0.05 Mon Apr 17 20:42:22 CEST 2006
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - added a debug() method (but all uses of it are commented out)
        - better socket management algorithm:
          + prevents deadlocks (as could occur when having a connection and
            a tunneled connection within it both going through Net::Proxy)
          + limits buffering (so as to avoid sucking a lot of memory
            when one socket sends data faster than its peer can accept it)
        [SCRIPTS]
        - patched sslh so that it can listen not only on localhost.
          (Thanks to Dieter Voegtli.)

0.04 Tue Jan 17 14:47:20 CET 2006
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - added some basic information logging 
          (enable with Net::Proxy->set_verbosity( $level ))
        [TESTS]
        - test for several failure cases
        - the test suite now covers more than 95% of the code
        [SCRIPTS]
        - patched sslh so that it works correctly, now

0.03 Wed Jan 11 02:10:52 CET 2006
        [DOCUMENTATION]
        - Correct SYNOPSIS for Net::Proxy::Connector::tcp
        - Added a SYNOPSIS for Net::Proxy::Connector::connect
        [NEW CONNECTOR]
        - Net::Proxy::Connector::dual
        [SCRIPTS]
        - previously unreleased sslh script ported to use Net::Proxy

0.02 Tue Jan 10 09:43:23 CET 2006
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - added the README and Changes files
        - added statistical methods to Net::Proxy
        - mainloop($max) will refuse new connections after $max
          connections have started
        [NEW CONNECTOR]
        - Net::Proxy::Connector::connect
        [SCRIPTS]
        - connect-tunnel ported to use Net::Proxy

0.01 Fri Jan  6 03:32:46 CET 2006
        [FEATURES]
        - The proxy is fully functionnal, but lacks several types
          of connectors
        [CONNECTORS]
        - Net::Proxy::Connector::tcp
        - Net::Proxy::Connector::dummy
