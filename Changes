Revision history for Perl extension Net::Proxy

0.07 Sat Sep  2 19:47:24 CEST 2006
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - added support for SSL proxies (ssl connector)
        [NEW CONNECTOR]
        - Net::Proxy::Connector::ssl
        [TESTS]
        - add support for NET_PROXY_VERBOSITY environnement variable
          in the tests, to have more verbose tests if needed

0.06 Thu Apr 20 21:27:00 CEST 2006
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - add support for "hooks" on received data, as proposed by Martin
          Werthmöller (see http://www.cpanforum.com/threads/1991),
          but with a different implementation

0.05 Mon Apr 17 20:42:22 CEST 2006
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - added a debug() method (but all uses of it are commented out)
        - better socket management algorithm:
          + prevents deadlocks (as could occur when having a connection and
            a tunneled connection within it both going through Net::Proxy)
          + limits buffering (so as to avoid sucking a lot of memory
            when one socket sends data faster than its peer can accept it)
        [SCRIPTS]
        - patched sslh so that it can listen not only on localhost.
          (Thanks to Dieter Voegtli.)

0.04 Tue Jan 17 14:47:20 CET 2006
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - added some basic information logging 
          (enable with Net::Proxy->set_verbosity( $level ))
        [TESTS]
        - test for several failure cases
        - the test suite now covers more than 95% of the code
        [SCRIPTS]
        - patched sslh so that it works correctly, now
